# Instruction

In this Assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of the data science methodology by applying it to a given problem. Pick one of the following topics to apply the data science methodology to:
1. Emails
2. Hospitals
3. Credit Cards

You will have to play the role of the client as well as the data scientist to come up with a problem that is more specific but related to these topics. Please note that this assignment is worth 10% of your final grade.

# My Submission

**Project Title** *
Analysis of the ways an effective email spam detection.

**Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to? (2 points)**
I chose email for pesonal, business, etc as my topic and my problem daily that many people as the same problem too with applying the data science methodology.

**Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist** 

**Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer. (3 points)**

**You are required to:**
**Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected.**
**Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data.**

**For example, using the food recipes use case discussed in the labs, the question that we defined was, "Can we automatically determine the cuisine of a given dish based on its ingredients?"**
We receive many emails everyday. I may sort emails into some categories like Promotions, Social, Transaction, Important/Not Important, Spam, and so on to see which ones are worth looking at again and not worth looking at the contents of the email.

Problem Question: How can we leverage data to improve email communication efficiency, strengthen email security against spam, and effectively categorize emails based on their content?

**Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with. (5 points):**

**1. Analytic Approach**
**2. Data Requirements**
**3. Data Collection**
**4. Data Understanding and Preparation**
**5. Modeling and Evaluation**

**You can always refer to the labs as a reference with describing how you would complete each stage for your problem.**
| Business Understanding stage | Caption |
| ------ | ------ |
| Analytic Approach | Started descriptive analytics where to understand current email communication patterns and trends, and predictive analytics to forecast email performance and identify potential security threats. How it works is that by calculating the probability of crime happening at a location, then based on the historical data as well as real-time information it suggests the best possible way to fight the probable crime. Prescriptive analytics can ingest historical crime data with several data points like crime date, location, type of convict, nature of convicts, spatial data, real-time surveillance information, satellite imagery, audio and visual feeds, and many more, and enhance email security measures. With prescriptive systems in place, it is now possible to detect, prevent, and fight a crime even before it has happened. ![Prescriptive-Analytics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd72d598-0134-4d8d-980d-d6c61e5bf8f3) |
| Data Requirements | We would require a diverse range of email-related data, including email content, sender and recipient information, timestamps, email engagement metrics (e.g., open rates, click-through rates), and spam indicators.  |
| Data Collection | Data collection would involve accessing internal email servers,  cybersecurity tools, and third-party data providers to gather relevant email data. We would need to ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and implement appropriate data security measures to protect sensitive information. |
| Data Understanding and Preparation |In this stage, we would like to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into email communication patterns, identify anomalies, and detect potential security threats. Data preprocessing steps such as cleaning, feature extraction, and normalization would be performed to prepare the data for subsequent analysis. Additionally, we may need to anonymize or pseudonymize personally identifiable information (PII) to protect privacy. |
| Modeling and Evaluation | For modeling and evaluation, we could employ a variety of techniques for example email content analysis using natural language processing (NLP), machine learning algorithms for email classification (e.g., spam detection), and time series forecasting for email performance prediction. Models would be evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and validated through cross-validation or holdout datasets. Holdout datasets, also known as test data, are a portion of data that are not used for training or validating machine learning models. They are used for the final evaluation of a model's performance before it is put into production. Additionally, feedback from the stakeholders and the domain experts would be incorporated to refine models and ensure practical utility in real-world email communication scenarios. |
